      Art is everywhere and museums bring a one of a kind experience, curated in
      a way that takes you on a certain journey (obviously the experience is
      different for each person). <br />
      South Africa currently has 51 museums with my favourite being the
      Apartheid museum.

        The <strong>Apartheid Museum</strong> located in <em>Johannesburg, South Africa</em> opened in 2001 and is acknowledged as the pre-eminent museum in the world dealing with 20th century South Africa, at the heart of which is the apartheid story. The Apartheid
      Museum, the first of its kind, illustrates the rise and fall of apartheid.
      An architectural consortium, comprising several leading architectural
      firms, conceptualised the design of the building on a seven-hectare stand.
      The museum is a superb example of design, space and landscape offering the
      international community a unique South African experience. The exhibits
      have been assembled and organised by a multi-disciplinary team of
      curators, film-makers, historians and designers. They include provocative
      film footage, photographs, text panels and artefacts illustrating the
      events and human stories that are part of the horrific period in our
      history, known as apartheid.<br />
